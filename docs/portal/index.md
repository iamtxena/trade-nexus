# Trade Nexus Documentation Portal

This portal is the canonical docs entrypoint for Gate-based delivery in Trade Nexus.

Portal delivery is built by Docusaurus from MD/MDX source files in this directory (`docs/portal/`), with framework policy defined in `/docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0003-docs-portal-framework.md`.

## Navigation Baseline

Portal sections follow the IA defined in `/docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_IA_AND_GOVERNANCE.md`:

- Platform
- API
- CLI
- Data Lifecycle
- Operations

## Start Here

- User quickstart: [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md)
- Team and integrator onboarding: [Onboarding Paths](getting-started/onboarding.md)
- Strategy/backtest/deploy path: [Strategy to Deploy Flow](cli/strategy-backtest-deploy.md)
- Gate evidence matrix: [Gate0 and Gate1 Traceability](operations/gate0-gate1-traceability.md)

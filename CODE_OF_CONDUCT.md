# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private communication that others find unwelcome
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at the repository's issue tracker or by contacting the maintainers directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.

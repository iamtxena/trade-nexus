# ADR-0003: Documentation Portal Framework and API Reference Delivery

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-02-14

## Context

Gate1 Docs Team needs a documentation system that:

1. provides a navigable docs portal (not ad-hoc markdown only),
2. keeps markdown/MDX as source-of-truth authoring format,
3. generates API reference directly from OpenAPI,
4. enforces build, link, and schema checks in CI.

## Decision

1. Use **Docusaurus** as the docs portal framework.
2. Keep documentation source files in Markdown/MDX under `/docs/portal/`.
3. Use **Redocly** (`build-docs`) to generate API reference HTML from `/docs/architecture/specs/platform-api.openapi.yaml` into Docusaurus static assets.
4. Enforce docs governance in CI through `.github/workflows/docs-governance.yml`, including:
   - docs build,
   - link validation,
   - frontmatter/schema validation,
   - stale-reference validation.

## Consequences

- Docs changes are validated with the same rigor as contract changes.
- API reference stays contract-derived and reproducible.
- Teams deliver docs as source (`.md`/`.mdx`) while portal output is generated by build.

## Alternatives Considered

- MkDocs: rejected for Gate1 because Docusaurus better aligns with MDX authoring and portal customization needs.
- Hand-authored API docs: rejected due to contract drift risk.
